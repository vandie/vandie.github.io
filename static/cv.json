    "description": "My name is Michael. I am a full stack javascript developer based in Liverpool. At age 16, I founded a limited company to sell a web based reward system to businesses. I worked on this product with 2 others and while it is no longer running, it helped me to gain an appreciation for various aspects of the software development and sales cycle. At the beginning of 2018, I joined Mashbo, where I currently work on client based web apps and websites. I have worked on numerous open source projects which can be found on my linked Github and Twitter accounts. I am a strong member of any team and am always happy and open to new ideas and approaches."

After working with the in-house designer to split his design into \"blocks, My coworkers agreed and I looked at building a prototype for the system. A little after the site was signed off by the client, Wordpress Gutenberg was released with many of the same ideas that we had put into the CAT website.",
