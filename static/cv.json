		"description": "My name is Michael. I am a full stack javascript developer based in Liverpool. At age 16, I founded a limited company to sell a web based reward system to businesses. While that product is no longer accessible to the public, I used it as a jumping off platform to get my foot into the development world. After some time at an internship and a stint at a web development agency, I got a job at Puntt. I have been working at Puntt since partway through 2019 and have been responsible for updating and maintaining the core systems for day to day business. I'm a confident individual, who likes to keep my skills on the cutting edge, and a potential asset to any team."
